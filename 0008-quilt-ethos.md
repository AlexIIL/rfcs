# Summary

Quilt has a set of Community Guidelines and Governance RFCs. These provide a set of rules, expectations and guideance on what and how certain aspects of the project should be managed. After some reflection, it seems that a set of "Values" had not been define; the aim of this document is to set these values.

# Motivation

This can be seen as a derivate or inspiration from the Python Projects [PEP20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). I (ToffeeMax) have found this document useful when trying to both write better code using Python and as a general set of development principles. PEP20 could partially be seen as non-serious, however it is referenced within Python frequently. 

The can be refered back to as more of a "Why" a decision was made - instead of the rigid proccess of HOW that other RFCs intend.


# Explanation

The proposed to aphorisms are:

1. Do not let perfect be the enemy of actually shipping an idea to usage.
2. Modular, Simple and Flexible should be the goal of all design.
3. Collaborate to Innovate
4. Keep disagreements internal -- always.
5. Consulting with many voices is good, but at some point you have to make a decision.  
6. All players deserve a chance to explain themselves and have actions against them be reviewed by someone not involved originally.
7. Tiny Potato got old -- time to find something new


# Drawbacks

It could be used in future as a "hill to die on" and be constantly refered back to in reference to why a certiain decision has been made or those seeking to question a decision as not being inline with the project

# Rationale and Alternatives

## Alternatives
- This could be included in the contributing.md or elsewhere in another document
- Splitting into two types, one for community and one for development could be wise; however it should be in the same document.

# Prior Art

This can be seen as a derivate or inspiration from the Python Project's [PEP20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

# Unresolved Questions

- Does this need to exist?
- Do we need more development focused ethos instead of community?
- Is this enforaceable or should it be included elsewhere?
