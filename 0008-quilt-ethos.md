# Summary

Quilt has a set of Community Guidelines and Governance RFCs. These provide a set of rules, expectations and guidance on what and how certain aspects of the project should be managed. After some reflection, it seems that a set of "Values" had not been define; the aim of this document is to set these values.

# Motivation

This can be seen as a derivate or inspiration from the Python Projects [PEP20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). I (ToffeeMax) have found this document useful when trying to both write better code using Python and as a general set of development principles. PEP20 could partially be seen as non-serious, however it is referenced within Python frequently. 

The can be refered back to as more of a "Why" a decision was made - instead of the rigid proccess of HOW that other RFCs intend.


# Explanation

We will sometimes get things wrong, but:
Do not let perfect be the enemy of actually shipping an idea.
Modular, Simple and Flexible.
Made by Anyone;
Made for Anyone.
This project breaths on collaboration.
Not sure whether something will work? Try it. 
Other will help shape it to something amazing.
Spread out power and responsibilty; it is a heavy burden to walk alone.
Tiny Potato got old; find an new hill to march apon. I here a pinapple is good?



# Drawbacks

It could be used in future as a "hill to die on" and be constantly refered back to in reference to why a certiain decision has been made or those seeking to question a decision as not being inline with the project

# Rationale and Alternatives

## Alternatives
- This could be included in the contributing.md or elsewhere in another document
- Splitting into two types, one for community and one for development could be wise; however it should be in the same document.

# Prior Art

This can be seen as a derivate or inspiration from the Python Project's [PEP20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

# Unresolved Questions

- Does this need to exist?
- Do we need more development focused ethos instead of community?
- Is this enforaceable or should it be included elsewhere?
