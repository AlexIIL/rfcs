RFC 5: Quilt Community Guidelines
# Summary
This document exists as a minimum set of general guidelines that dictate how community members, moderators, and administrators should behave on all Quilt platforms. It is deliberately written with the intent of being expanded on.

This document refers extensively to "The Quilt Community", which can be defined as all official spaces that facilitate communication, including but not limited to:
 - The official Quilt Discord server
 - The Quilt GitHub organization and repositories
 - The Quilt wiki spaces

# Explanation
The goal of this document is to set the overall tone and expectations for members of the Quilt community. This is not an exhaustive list of what users can and cannot do. It is instead provided as a way for individuals to moderate themselves to the best of their ability. With that in mind, there are two rules that Quilt community members must follow at all times:
 1. Be respectful and considerate of others
 2. Listen to and obey project staff

With those two rules in mind, there are specific behaviors that should be avoided in the QuiltMC community. The following behavior is unacceptable:
 1. Using language or posting content that can reasonably be considered discriminatory. Most of the language banned here should be obvious, but will be listed in more detail below in [Zero Tolerance Items](#zero-tolerance-items).
 2. Posting pornographic, distasteful, or excessively violent content. Again, see [Zero Tolerance Items](#zero-tolerance-items).
 3. Spamming or excessively sending messages, including repeating questions, resending links too frequently, or posting the same question to multiple channels. Spam bots andd trolling users may be immediately banned without warning.
 4. Formatting usernames to be difficult to read, to impersonate others, to advertise, or to violate other community rules.
 5. Messaging or harassing other users, including staff, moderators, or contributors, without valid reason.

## Zero Tolerance Items
Particularly severe issues represent a behavior and a kind of person that should not be associated with the Quilt project in any way. These behaviors will result in an immediate ban without warning:
 - Racial slurs or racist speech
 - Sexist slurs or sexist speech
 - Homophobic or transphobic slurs or speech
 - Ableist slurs or speech â€” there's confusion around this term, so to help clarify:
    - Ableist slurs are words that refer to people with disabilities used as insults
    - Ableist speech is hate speech directed towards people with disabilities
 - Any other hate speech not explicitly listed
 - Doxxing people
 - Personal attacks

This list is not exhaustive. If a user is engaging in bad behavior not conductive to a friendly environment, it may warrant an immediate ban.

# Drawbacks
The drawbacks of an intentionally loose set of guidelines are those who will make unfaithful interpretations in an attempt to circumvent the rules. This isn't a fatal flaw, but definitely something to be aware of.

# Prior Art
This document borrows some structure and wording directly from [PaperMC's community guidelines](https://papermc.io/community-guidelines), as well as inspiration from [FabricMC's code of conduct](https://github.com/FabricMC/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Unresolved Questions
This document intentionally does not go into great detail about sanctions or punishments that may be carried out. Such things will vary on a case-by-case basis, and largely be up to the discretion of the acting moderator at the time.
